/*
 * ElementConfig is a simple class that captures the attributes of a chemical 
 * element. All attributes are set by the constructor and are finalized.
 * 
 * Element Configurations class contains:
 * 
 * Symbol						Chemical element symbol.
 * Name							Chemical element name.
 * Z							Atomic Number.
 * Group						In chemistry, a group (also known as a family) 
 * 								is a column of elements in the periodic table 
 * 								of the chemical elements. There are 18 
 * 								numbered groups in the periodic table, and the 
 * 								f-block columns (between groups 3 and 4) are 
 * 								not numbered. The elements in a group have 
 * 								similar physical or chemical characteristics 
 * 								of the outermost electron shells of their 
 * 								atoms (i.e., the same core charge), as most 
 * 								chemical properties are dominated by the 
 * 								orbital location of the outermost electron. 
 * 								The modern numbering group 1 to group 18 is 
 * 								recommended by the International Union of Pure 
 * 								and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
 * Group32						The column number from the expanded periodic 
 * 								table (1 to 32).
 * Period						A period in the periodic table is a row of 
 * 								chemical elements. All elements in a row have 
 * 								the same number of electron shells. Each next 
 * 								element in a period has one more proton and is 
 * 								less metallic than its predecessor.
 * AtomicWeight					Relative atomic mass or atomic weight is a 
 * 								dimensionless physical quantity defined as the 
 * 								ratio of the average mass of atoms of a 
 * 								chemical element in a given sample to one 
 * 								unified atomic mass unit. The unified atomic 
 * 								mass unit is defined as being being 1/12 of the 
 * 								atomic mass of a carbon-12 atom.
 * Density						Density in g/cm^3.
 * Melt							Melting point in K.
 * Boil							Boiling point in K.
 * C							Specific heat capacity in J/g.K.
 * X							Electronegativity is a chemical property that 
 * 								describes the tendency of an atom to attract 
 * 								a shared pair of electrons towards itself
 * Abundance					Abundance of elements in Earth's crust in PPM.
 * Subcategory					Index into the Subcategories list.
 * GenElectronConfigCounts		Electron Configuration generated using 
 * 								Madelung's rule (see ElectronConfigurations 
 * 								for order).
 * ElectronConfigurationCounts	Observed Electron Configuration.
 * ElectronSubshellCounts		Electron count within each subshell (see  
 * 								ElectronSubshells for order).
 * ElectronShellCounts			Electron count within each shell.
